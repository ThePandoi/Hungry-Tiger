# About the Project
Often when students move to a new place, they have no idea what restaurants are good. This application aims to introduce students living on school campus to different cuisines in their area by allowing them to explore the 
menus and check the ratings of the restaurants along with their individual dishes. The application runs through a textfile database that provides the information of all the resturants nearby along with their ratings and reviews 
given by other students.
